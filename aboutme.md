##### "Without data, you're just another person with an opinion."  - W. Edward Demming

Perhaps the most important thing I learned early in management consulting is the **value of thorough and accurate data analysis** and the **power of pursuasive storytelling with its results.**  During a 20+ year career consulting in Fortune 500 organizations, I've led countless enterprise technology initiatives that crossed multiple divisions and departments (very common in a lot of today's matrix organizations). Since these division/department leaders all typically have different agendas, opinions and experiences with technology projects, typically these *transformational initiatives* require consistent and sustained education and socialization of the project - its impacts, its benefits, time and resource commitments, change management considerations, the schedule, etc. 

Addressing these items is best accomplished with solid data-driven project artifacts (i.e. the business case, the budget model, the project plan, the communications plan, etc.). It must make sense to everyone 

I learned that it is a combination of data and storytelling that inspires and motivates others. In my experience, people can be skeptical until they *know* that you have:
1. Thought everything through and that data can soundly answer any questions they have, and;
2. They can "see" what the future looks like after the technology change is deployed
