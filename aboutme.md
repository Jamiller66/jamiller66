"I am curious what the data says.....". I have always been intrigued by what can be learned from deep multi-faceted analysis of data. Data outputs are everywhere. They could be from a specific business process, a transactional technology platform, an environmental sensors, or subjective survey responses from something like medication response. I am also an avid technologist. I have forever been an early adopter of new technologies and more interested how new hardware or software can provide efficiency through automation. My passion for data and automation have driven my career from learning spreadsheet formulas to building robust Excel models to SQL to **R** and **Python** programming.
