##### "Without data, you're just another person with an opinion."  - W. Edward Demming

Perhaps the most important thing I learned early in management consulting is the **value of thorough and accurate data analysis** and the **power of pursuasive storytelling with its results.**  During a 20+ year career consulting in Fortune 500 organizations, I've led countless enterprise technology initiatives that crossed multiple divisions and departments (very common in a lot of today's matrix organizations). Since these division/department leaders all typically have different agendas, opinions and experiences with technology projects, I feel strongly that these types of *transformational initiatives* always require consistent and sustained education and socialization of the project - its impacts, its benefits, time and resource commitments, change management considerations, the schedule, etc. The most effective way I found to ensure cooperation and commitment (and to avoid delay) is with a well-written master project communique supported by data driven briefs for all major project artifacts (i.e. the business case, the budget model, the project plan, the communications plan, etc.)  

I learned that it is a combination of data and storytelling that inspires and motivates others. In my experience, people want to know that you have:
1. Thought everything through and that data can soundly answer any questions they have, and;
2. They can "see" what the future looks like after the technology change is deployed.

or subjective survey responses from something like medication response. I am also an avid technologist. I have forever been an early adopter of new technologies and more interested how new hardware or software can provide efficiency through automation. My passion for data and automation have driven my career from learning spreadsheet formulas to building robust Excel models to SQL to **R** and **Python** programming.
