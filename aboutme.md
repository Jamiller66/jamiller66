subtitle: The Art and Science of Data  
---

I like to investigate data. I have always been intrigued by what can be learned from deep multi-faceted analysis of data. Data outputs are everywhere. They could be from a specific business process, a transactional technology platform, an environmental sensors, or a subjective survey of something like medication response. I am also an avid technologist. I have forever been an early adopter of new technologies and more interested how new hardware or software can provide efficiency through automation.

During a 20+ year career consulting for Fortune 500 organizations, I led countless analysis efforts using Data including:
- Business Case Development
- Financial Modeling
- Business Unit & Corporate P&L Budgeting
- Marketing Analytics
- Sales Forecasting
- Resource Growth models

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
