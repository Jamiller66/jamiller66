title: What is DataScience?
subtitle: What I've learned about how companies use data
---

Companies typically use data in 3 ways with varying levels of maturity.

#### Business Intelligence

Business Intelligence is a product of Data Analytics that encompasses **consistently** getting the **right** data to the **right** business leaders in a format that facilitates efficient **interpretation** for their business needs.  It is taking data created *within* the company, cleaning it, formatting and arranging it effectively and delivering it where it is needed.

_Experience and knowledge needed:_ 
 - Data cleaning: minimal
 - Data transformation: high
 - Data visualization: high
 - Statistics: minimal
 - Programming: minimal
 - Technical Engineering: none
 - Domain knowledge: helpful

#### Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a product of DataScience that develops and refines **models**, and puts them in production, where they will run continuously. They work on building and improving **algorithms** for things like search results of an e-commerce site, optimizing a recommendation system, or estimating prices based on continuously flowing data.  Machine Learning engineers do not spend time on things like creating visualizations, but rather doing the  programming work of data science to build and enhance **models**.

_Experience and knowledge needed:_    
- Data cleaning: high
- Data transformation: high
- Data visualization: low
- Statistics: high
- Programming: high
- Technical Engineering: high
- Domain knowledge: necessary

#### Decision Science

Decision Science turns a companyâ€™s raw data into information that helps the company to **make decisions**. This work relies on having a deep understanding of different **mathematical and statistical methods** and a familiarity with business decision-making. Furthermore, due to their complexity, analyses from Decision Science require compelling visualizations and tables to facilitate their understanding by non-technical audiences. While a decision scientist does plenty of programming, their work generally only gets run once to make a particular analysis.
