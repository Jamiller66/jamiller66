Often I find using RMarkdown is a great tool to create reports and deliverables when analyzing data for clients. This is a sample of a type of report I've often created for Health System Pharmacies with their dispensing data. Surprisingly many do not have the personnel or the tools and expertise to create routine reporting on Drugs dispensed, referring physicians, volume by location and other key metrics. Creating this type of a report in an HTML format allows distributiion throughout the organization without the need to open a decifer complex multi-tab spreadsheets. This one includes revenue breakdowns by Specialty area as well as a top 10 highest revenue drugs. Once built, these reports are automated to run and distribute on any desired interval.
