#### Combining Analysis within an HTML report

Often I find using RMarkdown is a great tool to create reports and deliverables when analyzing data for clients. This is a smaple of a tyoe of report I've often created for Health System Specialty Pharmacies with their dispensing data. Often they dont have the personnel or the tools to create routine reporting on Drugs dispensed, referring physicians, volume by location and other key metrics.  This one includes revenue breakdowns by Specialty area as well as a top 10 highest revenue drugs.
