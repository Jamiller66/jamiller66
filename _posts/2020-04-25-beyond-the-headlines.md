On March 18th 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom declared that his **model** indicated that 56% of California’s population, or 25.5 million people, would be infected with COVID-19 over the next eight-week period. While the numbers (fortunately) did not meet the forecast of his **model**, the doomsday headline no doubt contributed to fear, unease and restlessness among California citizens. And it is easy to see why.  Let's assume (for arguments sake) the average citizen reads that headline. I believe he or she is likely thinking two things;
1. Government agencies have well-trained statisticians and real-time access to comprehensive data on cases, hosptializations and deaths. 
2. The govenment wants use this data for decision making to ensure the safety of its citizens.

So as the **model** (and a multitude of others) proves over time to be substantially inacccurate, is there any doubt as to why statistical models and forecasts are increasingly scoffed and ignored by much of our population?

The issue with models is that in most cases there is little **transparency** as to how a model is built. Models (even AI models) are generally driven from 1. manual inputs and/or 2. Pattern recognition and refinement.

At the heart of the struggle are two very different ideas of success—survival-driven and soul-driven. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others. Success is the absence of material suffering, the nourishing of the soul be damned. It is an odd and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world often resides in the hands of younger souls. Still working in the egoic and material realms, they love the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation. Older souls tend not to be as materially driven. They have already played the worldly game in previous lives and they search for more subtle shades of meaning in this one—authentication rather than accumulation. They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they really are the truest warriors.

A soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our innate image. Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. Flake it till you make it.
