##### Crime by Florida Counties
I have been spending some time familiarizing myself with Tableau 2020.3 and thought I'd take a look at per capita crime rates in the State of Florida over the last few years.  I was able to gather multiple spreadsheets (1 per year for 2019, 2018 and 2017) from the FDLE website (https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/Data-Statistics/UCR-Offense-Data.aspx) I chose to join the data and rank the counties with respect to **rates** of traditional criminal felonies (Murder, Rape, Burglary, Robbery, Larceny, Motor Vehicle Theft). As a Floridian, I've always read about the crime in South Florida (Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties) but I wondered if they are truly the most dangerous based on population. While sparsely populated there are some counties with higher incidents of crime per 100K residents. Should we all avoid Bay County?

##### Specialty Pharmacy Dispensing Dashboard
This is a sample of a dashboard I originally created in R-Shiny for a client showing their desired key basic drug dispensing metrics. This Specialty Pharmacy was run by a Health System that was embarking on an outreach program to their employed specialty physicians. Specialty physicians treat many patients with chronic diseases using long-term drug therapy with specialized administration requirements and complex dosing schedules. The goal of the program was to sell the benefits of the pharmacy and its proactive patient and therapy management programs to these physicians so that they would have a familiarty with a Specialty Pharmacy to recommend for patients. 

One of the main goals of the dashboard was tracking the script volume of all physicians within a specific specialty (i.e Oncology, Gastroenterology, Rheumatology, etc.) This allowed insight on which physicians were not sending many scripts to the Specialty Pharmacy in order to target the education and outreach.
